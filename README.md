## 🧑‍💻 What I Learned
1. **Importance of Security**  
   Implementing two-step authentication using PHPMailer and OTPs taught me how crucial secure login systems are for protecting user data.

2. **Time Management and Team Collaboration**  
   Prior experience highlighted the need for structured planning. This project was executed on time thanks to clear task allocation and consistent progress reviews.

3. **Technological Challenges**
